# Problem solving
i start to solve algorithm problems from mastafa ibrahim saad [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839), for me i love to see others solution, so i think it will be helpful if i share my code on github.

i solve many problems in hackerrank previously, you can see my account [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/emanNahed20)

if you have any question about my code, you can make an issue and i will reply. 

happy learning :)).
